When you don't know how your app works, you don't control the data in it, 
so why don you even wanna give device admin permission to a third party app when you can 
BUILD one yourself. This ain't perfect, but atleast trustWorthy !

Clone the code in android studio and let it take care of the rest and modify the package name if you would like to sign it yourself

Note : You can only use primary source of verification, that is pin, passsword or pattern if you use this app to lock the device.
You CANNOT use face unlock or fingerprint with this app.

I am exploring this and i will try more ways to optimise it.
